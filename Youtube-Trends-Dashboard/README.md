2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the data to support meaningful visualization.

3. **Data Visualization:** Utilize ggplot and plotly libraries to create various types of static and interactive plots.

4. **Dashboard Creation:** Develop a static dashboard using flexdashboard to present the visualized data and insights.
